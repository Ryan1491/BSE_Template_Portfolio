# Solar Panel Sun Tracker - Phone Charger
Hi, I’m Ryan! The project that I chose is a solar panel sun tracker that uses a servo motor, photo-resistors, and of course a solar panel! This device tracks the movement of sun light allowing the solar panel to receive the maximum amount of sunlight to power a phone.

﻿# About the Creator
Ever since I was little, I would tell my family that I wanted to become an engineer. There is even a quote of me saying that I wanted to become an engineer in my 5th grade yearbook. Although I knew I wanted to become an engineer, I never knew what type. Now in the BlueStamp Engineering Program I am exploring the variety of types of engineering, with the project I am working on.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was getting the servo motor and the photo-resistors to correspond with each other. To begin this project I familiarized myself with the tools I was using, as it was my first time ever building something mechanical with computer science. Next, I assembled the basic structure of my device using: multiple wires, servo motor, photo-resistors, arduino board, breadboard, and 4 band resistors. After assembling, I implemented the code on to the arduino board using my computer. Unfortunatly, I ran into a problem, the servo motor was not calibrated correctly. When I input a certain amount of rotation, for example 90 degrees, the servo motor would begin to constantly spin. To fix this I made sure that all the wires were firmly connected, made sure the code was correct, and through some troubleshooting, I was able to get the servo motor to work correctly. Now when more light is detected on one photo-resistor, the servo motor will move accordingly until both photo-resistors detect equal amount of light.
